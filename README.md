# Redash-chatbot-add-on

Our company is seeking to significantly enhance its data analysis capabilities, specifically focusing on comprehensive YouTube data exploration. The aim of this project is to build a novel Redash chat add-on that our team members can use to extract insight from multiple Redash dashboards and from connected databases using natural language. The chat add-on enables a seamless  conversation in a question and answer format and autonomous knowledge discovery.  User queries could be about what is already displayed in the dashboard or questions that require generating SQL query using LLMs to be run against our connected databases. The end-to-end system you will help us build will empower and allow our team members to extract deep, meaningful, and actionable insights from our business intelligence (BI) platforms.
